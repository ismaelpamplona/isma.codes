## Introduction

With the development of the Brazilian technology sector, the demand for robust API systems for payroll has become crucial. Rust, a language designed for performance and safety, is an excellent choice for such systems. This article explores why Rust is ideal for building Brazilian payroll API systems, with examples from the `abroad-payroll-api`.

## Why Rust for Payroll systems?

Rust offers memory safety guarantees, exceptional runtime performance and modern language constructs, making it suitable for API systems that demand reliability and efficiency. Here's how Rust stands out:

- **Safety**: Rust's ownership model prevents data races, a common issue in concurrent processing, which is a requirement for payroll systems handling multiple requests.
- **Performance**: Rust's zero-cost abstractions mean you don't have to sacrifice performance for expressiveness, an important consideration when dealing with large payroll data.
- **Concurrency**: Rust's concurrency model makes it easier to build scalable systems that can handle numerous API requests simultaneously without running into the common pitfalls of multi-threaded programming.

## Building the foreign payroll` API in Rust

The `abroad-payroll-api` uses the powerful ecosystem of Rust to ensure a reliable and performant service for managing payroll for Brazilian public agents abroad. Here is a snapshot of the `Cargo.toml` to give you an idea of the dependencies:

```toml
[package]
name = "abroad-payroll-api"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# Dependencies
axum = "0.7.4"
tokio = { version = "1.35.1", features = ["full"] }
sqlx = { version = "0.7", features = ["postgres"] }
```

This configuration emphasises the use of axum for web framework capabilities, tokio for asynchronous runtime and sqlx for database operations — all of which ensure a robust backend setup.

The `abroad-payroll-api` is structured to facilitate maintenance and scalability. Below is the API path structure of the project, showing a clean separation of concerns and modularity:

```
.
└── src/
    ├── handlers/
    ├── middlewares/
    ├── routes/
    ├── app.rs
    ├── main.rs
    └── response.rs
```

This structure allows developers to navigate the codebase easily and manage the API's components effectively.

Including the API path structure in this way sets the stage for a discussion of how Rust's design benefits the individual components of a web service.

## API Endpoints and Operations

For example, let's look at the endpoint for retrieving bank data:

```rs
// GET /banks
async fn get_banks() -> Result<Json<Vec<Bank>>, Error> {
    let banks = fetch_banks_from_db().await?;
    Ok(Json(banks))
}
```

This asynchronous function fetches bank data and demonstrates Rust's asynchronous capabilities for non-blocking I/O operations — a must for responsive APIs.

## Containerization with Docker

The abroad-payroll-api uses Docker for containerization to ensure that the API runs consistently in every environment. Here is a look at the Dockerfile.dev used:

```dockerfile
FROM rust:latest as builder
WORKDIR /usr/src/myapp
COPY . .
RUN cargo install --path .

FROM debian:buster-slim
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/myapp/target/release/abroad-payroll-api .
CMD ["./abroad-payroll-api"]
```

This multi-stage structure leads to a lighter final image that is ideal for use.

## Database and ORM

```rs
// Example SQLx query with compile-time checks
let rec: (i32, String) = sqlx::query_as("SELECT id, name FROM banks WHERE id = $1")
    .bind(bank_id)
    .fetch_one(&pool)
    .await?;
```

## Conclusion

Rust's combination of safety, performance and modern features makes it the first choice for creating system APIs such as the abroad-payroll-api. As the Brazilian financial sector requires increasingly sophisticated software solutions, Rust is ready to take on these challenges.

## Appendix: Collection Example

Below is an example of a collection to illustrate API usage:

```json
{
  "name": "abroad-payroll-api",
  "request": {
    "method": "GET",
    "url": "http://localhost:3030/banks"
  }
}
```

This collection simplifies testing and interaction with the API and demonstrates the usability and integration capabilities of the system.
