## Itroduction

- Why Python?
- Importance of Python in Modern Software Development
- Python's Popularity in the Tech Industry (Backed by Stats)

## Python Syntax: The Basics

- Variables and Data Types (Integers, Floats, Strings, Booleans)
- Control Flow (if, elif, else)
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions (def, arguments, return statements)
- Lambda Functions (Anonymous Functions)
- List Comprehensions
- Error Handling (try, except, finally)

## Object-Oriented Programming in Python

- Defining Classes and Objects
- Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation
- Dunder (Magic) Methods
- Abstract Classes and Interfaces
- Decorators and Class Methods

## Advanced Python: Features and Idioms

- Generators and Iterators
- Context Managers (with statement)
- Metaclasses
- Coroutines and async/await for Asynchronous Programming

## Python's Memory Management

- Memory Allocation in Python
- Reference Counting and Garbage Collection
- Stack and Heap in Python
- Memory Leaks and Tools to Detect Them (e.g., `gc` Module)
- Pythonâ€™s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and its Effects on Multithreading

## Collections and Data Structures in Python

- Lists, Tuples, and Sets: Mutable vs Immutable Types
- Dictionaries: Key-Value Pairs in Python
- Collections Module: NamedTuple, Counter, defaultdict, deque, OrderedDict
- Common List/Dict Operations and Methods (Sorting, Indexing, etc.)

## Libraries and Modules: Extending Python's Power

- Python's Standard Library Overview
  - `os`, `sys`, `math`, `datetime`, `re` (regular expressions)
  - `functools`, `itertools`, `collections`
- Virtual Environments and Package Management (`pip`, `poetry`)
- Popular Python Libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Requests, Flask/Django, Asyncio)

## Python for System-Level Programming

- Interfacing with C using Cython and ctypes
- Python and Memory Optimization (Buffer Protocol)

## Performance Considerations

- Profiling Python Code (cProfile, timeit)
- Performance Bottlenecks and Optimizations
- Using `multiprocessing` and `threading` to Improve Performance

## Python for Data Structures & Algorithms

- Python Implementations of Key Data Structures
  - Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs
- Key Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, Recursion
- Big O Notation with Python Examples

## Python for Web and API Development

- Introduction to Web Frameworks: Flask vs Django
- REST API Development with Flask/Django
- Connecting to Databases with SQLAlchemy or Django ORM

## Testing in Python

- Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Frameworks: Unittest, Pytest, and Coverage

## Python in Cloud and DevOps

- Using Python with AWS (Boto3)
- Python for Automation (Ansible, Terraform)
- Containerization and Deployment with Docker

## Conclusion

- Best Practices for Python Code (PEP 8, Clean Code)
- Resources for Further Learning
