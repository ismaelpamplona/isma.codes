## Introduction

Entering the world of web development can seem daunting at first, but understanding the core concepts and technologies can demystify the process considerably. This guide is designed to give beginners a comprehensive overview of how the web and the internet work, the technologies involved in web development and how to take your first steps in this exciting field.

## Understand how the web and the internet work

**How the Internet works:** At its core, the Internet is a vast network of computers connected around the world that can communicate and exchange data with each other. When you access the Internet, your device communicates with servers to retrieve the web content you want.

**How the web works:** The web is a service built on the Internet and consists of interlinked documents and resources. These resources are accessible via web browsers that use URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) to find specific pages or content on the web.

## Key technologies and terms in web development

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** HTML is the backbone of every website and determines the structure and content of web pages.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** CSS is used for the styling and visual organization of HTML elements on a page.
- **SCSS:** An extension of CSS, SCSS (Sassy CSS), allows for variables, nested rules and more, making stylesheets easier to maintain.
- **JavaScript (JS):** A programming language that enables dynamic interactions and functionality on web pages.
- **TypeScript (TS):** A superset of JavaScript that provides static types to detect errors early in the development process.
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment that builds on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and enables server-side execution of JavaScript.
- **Python:** A versatile programming language that can be used for backend web development, among other things.

## The journey of a URL: What happens when you press enter

When you type a URL into your browser and press enter, the browser initiates a series of steps to display the requested web page. This process includes resolving the domain name to an IP address through DNS (Domain Name System), connecting to the server via the IP address, sending an HTTP request, and receiving the HTTP response from the server, which is then rendered by the browser.

## Understanding web servers and hosting

A web server is a piece of software (and its underlying hardware) that stores, processes and delivers web pages to users. It waits for incoming requests from clients (browsers), processes these requests and responds with the requested resources, e.g. HTML pages, images and other files. When a web application is hosted, it is provided on a web server and made accessible via the Internet.

## Main elements of a web application

The main elements of a web application include

- **Frontend:** The client-side part of the application that users interact with directly. It is mainly created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- **Backend:** The server-side logic of the application that handles database interactions, user authentication and server configuration. Languages such as JavaScript (Node.js) and Python are usually used.
- **Database:** This is where the data is stored and retrieved by the web application, which is essential for dynamic content.
