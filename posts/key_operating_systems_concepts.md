- Context Switching: Costs and Impacts on Performance

## 3. Synchronization and Concurrency

- Concurrency in Operating Systems: Processes vs Threads
- Synchronization Mechanisms: Mutexes, Semaphores, Locks
- Deadlocks: Causes and Prevention
- Race Conditions and How to Handle Them
- Tools and Techniques for Thread Synchronization

## 4. Paging and Virtual Memory

- How Paging Works: Page Tables and Page Faults
- Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)
- Demand Paging and Its Impact on Performance
- Swapping: Managing Memory in Low-Memory Conditions
- Page Replacement Algorithms: FIFO, LRU, LFU

## 5. Multithreading and Parallelism

- What is Multithreading?
- CPU Scheduling in Multithreaded Systems
- Multi-core Processors and Parallel Execution
- Thread Pools and Their Use in Performance Optimization
- Challenges of Multithreading: Synchronization, Deadlocks, Performance Bottlenecks

## 6. Input/Output Management

- Role of OS in I/O Management
- Interrupt Handling and Device Drivers
- Disk Scheduling Algorithms: FCFS, SSTF, SCAN
- Buffering, Caching, and Spooling in I/O Management

## 7. File Systems

- How Operating Systems Manage Files and Directories
- File System Structure: Blocks, Inodes, and Superblocks
- File Allocation Methods: Contiguous, Linked, Indexed
- File Permissions and Access Control
- Journaling File Systems: Ext4, NTFS

## 8. CPU Scheduling

- CPU Scheduling Algorithms: Round Robin, Shortest Job First, Priority Scheduling
- Preemptive vs Non-Preemptive Scheduling
- Scheduling in Multithreaded and Multi-core Systems
- Real-Time Scheduling and Its Applications

## 9. Security and Access Control

- OS-Level Security Mechanisms: User Authentication, File Permissions
- Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Secure Process and Memory Management
- Common OS Security Vulnerabilities and Mitigations

## 10. OS Performance Optimization

- Tools for Monitoring OS Performance (e.g., `top`, `htop`, `vmstat`)
- Profiling CPU, Memory, and I/O Usage
- Techniques for Optimizing System Performance
- Reducing Overheads from Context Switching, Paging, and I/O Operations
