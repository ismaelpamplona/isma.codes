## Introduction

- Role of Databases in Modern Software Development
- Relational vs Non-Relational Databases: A Brief Overview

## Relational Databases

- Definition and Key Characteristics
- Structure: Tables, Rows, Columns, and Relationships
- SQL (Structured Query Language) for Data Manipulation
- ACID Properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- Examples of Relational Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle

## Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)

- Definition and Key Characteristics
- Types of NoSQL Databases:
  - Document Stores (e.g., MongoDB)
  - Key-Value Stores (e.g., DynamoDB, Redis)
  - Column Stores (e.g., Cassandra, HBase)
  - Graph Databases (e.g., Neo4j)
- BASE Properties (Basically Available, Soft State, Eventual Consistency)
- Examples of Non-Relational Databases: DynamoDB, MongoDB, Cassandra

## Trade-offs Between Relational and Non-Relational Databases

- Data Structure: Schemas vs Schema-less
- Query Flexibility vs Performance Scalability
- ACID vs BASE: Consistency vs Availability
- Storage and Retrieval Efficiency: Indexing and Partitioning
- Use Cases for Relational Databases
- Use Cases for Non-Relational Databases

## CAP Theorem and Its Implications

- Explanation of Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance
- Trade-offs in Distributed Database Systems

## Data Modeling in Relational Databases

- Normalization: Removing Redundancy
- Common Normal Forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- Denormalization: Performance Considerations

## Data Modeling in Non-Relational Databases

- Document-Oriented Data Models
- Key-Value Pair Data Models
- Wide-Column Data Models
- Graph Data Models

## Querying in Relational Databases

- SQL Basics: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
- Joins and Aggregations
- Transactions and Rollbacks

## Querying in Non-Relational Databases

- Key-Value and Document Queries
- Filtering and Aggregation in NoSQL
- Partitioning and Sharding Data for Scalability

## Indexing and Performance Optimization

- Indexing Strategies in Relational Databases
- Indexing Strategies in NoSQL Databases
- Query Optimization Techniques

## Amazon DynamoDB Overview

- Introduction to DynamoDB
- Key Features of DynamoDB (Key-Value Store, Document Store)
- Partitioning and Scaling with DynamoDB
- Use Cases and Best Practices for DynamoDB

## Conclusion

- Choosing the Right Database for the Application
- Balancing Consistency, Availability, and Scalability
- Summary of Key Differences and Trade-offs
